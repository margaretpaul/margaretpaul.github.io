They compete in the National Hockey League (NHL)(Also see <a href=https://carolineholzapfel.github.io/wa/wa3.html>Dallas Stars</a>, <a href=https://lillymcnichols.github.io/wa/wa3.html>Chicago Blackhawks</a>, <a href=https://emhe3766.github.io/WA/WA3.html>Florida Panthers</a>).

        <h2>Team History</h2>
        <h3>Early Years (1967-1984)</h3>
        <p>Prior to the arrival of the Penguins, Pittsburgh had been the home of the NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates from 1925 to 1930 and of the American Hockey League's Pittsburgh Hornets franchise from 1936 to 1967 (with a short break from 1956 to 1961). In the spring of 1965, Jack McGregor, a state senator from Kittanning, Pennsylvania, began lobbying campaign contributors and community leaders to bring an NHL franchise back to Pittsburgh. The group focused on leveraging the NHL as an urban renewal tool for Pittsburgh. The senator formed a group of local investors that included H. J. Heinz Company heir H. J. Heinz III, Pittsburgh Steelers' owner Art Rooney and the Mellon family's Richard Mellon Scaife. The projected league expansion depended on securing votes from the then-current NHL owners; to ensure Pittsburgh would be selected as one of the expansion cities, McGregor enlisted Rooney to petition votes from James D. Norris, owner of the Chicago Black Hawks and his brother Bruce Norris, owner of the Detroit Red Wings. The effort was successful, and on February 8, 1966, the National Hockey League awarded an expansion team to Pittsburgh for the 1967 to 68 season. The Penguins paid $2.5 million ($21.1 million today) for their entry and $750,000 ($6.1 million today) more for start-up costs. The Civic Arena's capacity was boosted from 10,732 to 12,500 to meet the NHL requirements for expansion. The Pens also paid an indemnification bill to settle with the Detroit Red Wings, which owned the Pittsburgh Hornets franchise. The investor group named McGregor president and chief executive officer, and he represented Pittsburgh on the NHL's Board of Governors.</p>

        <h2>Team Culture</h2>
        <h3>Fanbase</h3>
        <p>Today, the Penguins are one of the NHL's most popular teams, especially among American non-Original Six franchises, and are considered second behind the Steelers among Pittsburgh's three major professional sports teams, taking advantage of both its success and the Pittsburgh Pirates struggles both on and off the field. Especially notable was a 2007 survey done of the four major sports leagues' 122 teams. The Penguins surprised observers by being ranked 20th overall and third among NHL teams, while the Steelers were ranked number one and the Pirates (before the arrival of Andrew McCutchen and that team's turnaround) ranked much lower on the list than its peers. The Penguins' popularity has at times rivaled that of the Steelers at the local level.</p>
        <h3>Rivalries</h3>
        <h4>Philadelphia Flyers</h4>
        <p>Considered by some to be the best rivalry in the NHL, the Philadelphia Flyers and Pittsburgh Penguins rivalry began in 1967 when the teams were introduced in the NHL's "Next Six" expansion wave. The rivalry exists both due to divisional alignment and geographic location, as both teams play in Pennsylvania. The Flyers lead the head-to-head record with a 153 98 30 record. However, the Penguins eliminated the Flyers from the playoffs in 2008 and 2009 and were eliminated by them from the playoffs in 2012, strengthening the rivalry. Three years later, the Flyers won the sixth playoff meeting between the clubs to advance to the Conference Semi-finals. The franchises have met seven times in the playoffs, with the Flyers winning four series (1989 Patrick Division Finals, 4 to 3; 1997 Eastern Conference Quarter-finals, 4 to 1; 2000 Eastern Conference Semi-finals, 4 to 2; and 2012 Eastern Conference Quarter-finals, 4 to 2) and the Penguins winning three (2008 Eastern Conference Finals, 4 to 1; 2009 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals, 4 to 2; and 2018 Eastern Conference First Round, 4 to 2).</p>

        <h3>Arena</h3>
        <p>The Penguins called Civic Arena home for over 45 seasons from their inception in 1967. In September 2010, they completed the move to the state-of-the-art Consol Energy Center (now named the PPG Paints Arena). The Penguins also played two "home" games in the Cleveland suburb of Richfield, Ohio, in 1992 and 1993 at the Richfield Coliseum (this is not unlike the Cleveland Cavaliers of the NBA playing an annual pre-season game in Pittsburgh;[97] the Philadelphia 76ers used the Civic Arena as a second home in the early 1970s).[98]</p>
